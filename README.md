Extracted the nonce from the homepage JavaScript.  
Sent PHP wrapped in an Exception to get command output.  
Obtained shell access and found a hidden `.txt` flag.  
Identified a suspicious process `nm-inet-dialog` and related service.  
Located miner config file and extracted the wallet address.  
Used OSINT to connect the wallet to a known threat group.
